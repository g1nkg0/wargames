python ord(char)-65 returns the value needed for computation

possibilities
    a) Brute Force
        -> build list of keys length 6 and check against PyEnchant dictionairy
    b) Frequency Analysis
        -> every 6th character is (I+K)%26
        -> quantity determines which letter I is
        -> reverse the key somehow...
